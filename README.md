## How to use

1. Cloning and set up

```
git clone https://github.com/acyang97/CS3216-A3.git
$ cd server
$ npm i

2. Create the database

Follow the instructions to setup database locally.

Install postgres first. Then, create a database called `pern_starter` (Probably should rename this ).

In `db.js`, change the password to your local postgres password.

3. Starting the app

Go to the server folder and run `$ npm start` It will run on port `5000`

Go to the client folder and run `$ npm run start` It will run on `http://localhost:3000/`
